# Spacetime

Spacetime is a program that allows you to easily correlate microscopy images with some time-dependent external parameter like pressure, temperature, deposition rate, etc. It can directly show you what happened during a specific frame or even scan line. Since this program basically unifies space and time, what name could be more appropriate than Spacetime?

Spacetime can work with quite a few different data files, the most important type being LPM Camera .raw files. You can of course plot images from such a file, but you can also plot one or more channels as function of time, frequency (performing FFT) or versus another channel.

In addition, a couple of other data sources are implemented, mainly focusing on the gas control and analysis systems of the ReactorSTM and -AFM of the Interface Physics group at Leiden University. There is some support for plain text files as well.

The software is written in a very modular way and it's easy to add support for different data types. It's written in Python and runs on all common operating systems.

## Requirements

* Python 2.6 or later but not 3.x.
* numpy and scipy (probably any version will do)
* Matplotlib (1.0.1 or later)
* Traits, TraitsUI and Pyface (with WX backend), part of the and Enthought Tool Suite, version 4.0.0 or later.
* pytz
* Python Imaging Library (PIL)
* pyglet


## Optional dependencies:

 * FFmpeg (to generate videos)
 * AVbin (to load videos)
 * Camera Python Package (for the LPM Camera modules)


## Installation

### Windows installer

There is a fully self-contained Windows installer for Spacetime, get it from the [Spacetime website](http://spacetime.uithetblauw.nl/). The only external dependency is the [Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86)](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5582).

### Linux, Mac OS X, other unix...

There are no packages yet. Make sure the spacetime module is in your PYTHONPATH and run the included `spacetime` executable/script.
